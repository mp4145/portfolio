### Work Experience
**Data Analyst @ Columbia University (_October 2022 - Present_)**

*Sentiment Analysis of Courses based on Feedback*
- I am currently working on conducting sentiment analysis for course feedback forms to identify strengths and areas for enhancement.
- This analysis will provide actionable insights to improve course delivery and student satisfaction, ensuring a better educational experience.

*Data Migration and Optimization*
- The existing data management system had redundancies, and there was a need for a more organized and user-friendly solution.
- I migrated data from Google Drive to Airtable, created pre-filled forms for student surveys, tracked courses, and maintained comprehensive faculty profiles.
- I also established automation for alumni tracking post-graduation.
- These improvements streamlined data management, reduced redundancy, and enhanced communication regarding course requirements, benefiting both students and faculty.

*Mentor-Mentee Matchmaking*
- There was a need to connect students with suitable mentors based on specific preferences and expertise.
- I collected data on student preferences, including subject matter expertise, experience, and intended industries, and matched these with available alumni willing to mentor.
- This initiative fostered meaningful connections between students and mentors, enhancing the overall learning and professional development experience.

*Data-Driven Dashboard Development*
- I cleaned and organized historical student data and created a Tableau dashboard featuring demographic and geolocation information.
- This dashboard provided valuable insights that significantly improved admissions rates by enabling targeted marketing strategies primarily based on location.

*Revamping the website*
- I actively updated faculty profiles, redesigned the website structure to be more user-friendly, and managed updates for events and blog inquiries.
- The enhanced website attracted more visitors and improved engagement, making it easier for students and prospective students to access important information.

*Events Experience Enhancement*
- Each semester, the executive program hosts a three-day conference that requires meticulous coordination for a successful in-person gathering.
- I co-managed RSVPs, facilitated email communication, arranged catering, organized speaker presentations, set up sound systems, coordinated photographs, and managed location arrangements.
- I also maintained attendee records and collected feedback surveys for analysis.
- My contributions improved the overall experience for attendees and allowed for actionable insights through sentiment analysis and topic modeling, enhancing future events.
  
*Data Organization*
- The program had accumulated vast amounts of raw, disorganized data that hindered efficient access and utilization.
- I organized the data into structured Excel workbooks, co-established a shared Google Drive for consistent access, and segregated information for students, alumni, faculty, industry affiliates, mentors, and guests.
- This effort streamlined data access, improved collaboration, and enhanced the ability to retrieve and analyze information efficiently.


**Software Engineer @ Morgan Stanley (Contract) (_October 2022 - Present_)**
- Reduced wait times for ticket extraction from ServiceNow to JIRA using RESTful API, enhancing customer satisfaction and efficiency.
- Implemented test cases to validate edge cases, and maintain seamless integration between systems.
- Documented the API integration process, including setup instructions, data mapping schema, and troubleshooting guides.

### Projects
**Financial Market Forecasting Model**
Built a stock price prediction model leveraging TF-IDF vectors for feature extraction and SVM for classification. Achieved a validation accuracy of 57%, demonstrating robust predictive capabilities in financial markets.

**FinSnap** 
Created and deployed an AI-driven personal finance assistant as my capstone project. Scraped credit card, deals, and financial literacy data from the internet and stored them on Firebase. Trained the data on PaLM 2 model to answer user queries and deployed it on Vertex AI. Later, connected the model to the website and WhatsApp API via a webhook setup
using Glitch.

**Geospatial Analysis for US Chronic Diseases** 
Performed an in-depth geospatial analysis of chronic diseases in the USA, revealing nuanced patterns, with Cardiovascular Disease affecting males 15% more than females, and implemented D3 charts to showcase hierarchies in disease distribution, enhancing interactive data exploration and providing a user-friendly interface for end-users to gain insights effortlessly.
